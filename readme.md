# Front-end challenge - Selbetti

[Clique aqui para ler em Português](https://github.com/DanielMafra/selbetti-challenge/blob/main/readme.pt-BR.md)

Multi-step form created with bootstrap.

Live preview (functional demo): [https://selbetti-challenge.netlify.app/](https://selbetti-challenge.netlify.app/)

## Some considerations

In the folder named "version1", it contains the individual files of each step ("screen1.html", "screen2.html", ...) as requested in the challenge.

In the folder named "version2", it contains the extra challenge, which would be to create the functionality using a Javascript framework/library.

In this second case, I chose to use ReactJS, but trying to keep as much of the basic structure of the challenge as possible, componentizing only a few parts (even if I could componentize and reuse the code even more, I chose to keep the structure as faithful as possible to what I did in original challenge).

## Developed with

* [Bootstrap](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Some features

* ✅ Field validation
* ✅ Data persistence at every step
* ✅ Guaranteed access to the next step only if the previous one is finished
* ✅ Smartphone friendly layout

## Running the project (version2)

After having cloned the repository and accessed its folder through the terminal, go to folder "version2" and run the commands below (remember to have installed Node)

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm run dev
```
